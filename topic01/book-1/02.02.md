#Java Interfaces

A program component that contains
- Public constants
- Signatures for public methods
- Comments that describe them

Begins like a class definition - but use the word interface instead of class

~~~
public interface someClass
{
  public int someMethod();
}

##Interface Paradigm:

The files for an interface, a class that implements the interface, and the client.
