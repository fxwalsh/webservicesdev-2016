##Eclipse: Create an Interface

In the algorithms package, create a new interface, called `HelloWorldInterface`

Right-click on algorithms Package and Select New â€“> Interface

##Eclipse: Specifying a method 

Next, we shall specify a method display() in the Interface.  Recall interfaces only identify methods, and do NOT implement them (a WHAT operation)

Add the following line to your interface, so that it resembles:

~~~
public interface HelloWorldInterface 
{
  public void display();
}
~~~
