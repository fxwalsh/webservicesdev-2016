#Creating a Client 

In algorithms, create a new class called HelloWorldClient

Add a main function to HelloWorldClient, such that it resembles: package algorithms;

~~~
public class HelloWorldClient {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    HelloWorldInterface hw = new HelloWorld();
    hw.display();
  }
}
~~~

##Running the Client

Execute HelloWorldClient as a Java Application by right-clicking on HelloWorldClient and select `Run as -> Java Application`

You should see “Hello World!” displayed in the Eclipse console.

##Java Interfaces

Congratulations! You have now successfully:

- Set up your workspace
- Created an Interface
- Implemented that interface
- Created JUnit tests for interface/implementation
- Created a client that uses the interface/implementation
